/marisol/ Fix repl key error code (try and except)
/parker/ fix hitboxes for nonvisible sprites

Level Creation system (priority #1)
  /Parker/ Find an asset pack (I (parker) have one already)
    cut the assets
  Make separate file for loading sprites
  /gino and opal/ Make a level switcher (I think we should make a seperate          function for each level then put them in a class/otherfile then execute them)
  Start screen (use level switcher, very low priority, just a placeholder)
  Functions to place level background sprites manually
    Include a dynamic sprite resizer (sprite always fits the screen no matter the resolution)
  Goal object that brings the player to the calls the level switcher system
  Framework to place level sprites on a grid system

Enemys (priority #2 we should do level creation first)
  Health system
  Enemy 1
    Jump on head to kill
    Copy collision code from player class to this enemy class then have them change directions if they collide
  Enemy 2
    spike traps
      if colliding bring the player's health down by 1, lock it so they don't get hurt again unless they stop touching it then touch it again or add a health  cooldown/visual clue for health cooldown
      
	Movement (priority #3 we should do enemies)
    Wall jumping

  Nice title/start screen (priority #4)
		gives us bonus points
    "Hit the flag pole to start" Flag pole located on top of the title and the title is 
    at double jump height and then in order to reach the top of the title you need to 
    walljump between the letters. This introduces pretty much all mechanics/controls in the game
	
	Arrow keys (priority #5 something nice but uneccesary)
		non gamers use these to play games
		might wanna add key binding so they work the same as wasd

////Done/Canceled//////

X rectangle collisions

V -1/4/2021 - Get Current Build Working With Repl
  I think it doesn't like the file system I designed for animations.
    I had made it for personal computers, not repl servers.
    I think this can be fixed by making it use the local file path instead of the root.
  
X Find better alternative to repl.it (how do prof programmers work together?)

V -1/5/21 - Copied files to drive

V - 1/5/21 - Changed update_collision_list() to append to the collission list

 V Comment functions (no priority)
